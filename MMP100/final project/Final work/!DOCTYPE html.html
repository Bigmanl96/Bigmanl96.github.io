            Working at a big warehouse for a big company can be a total pain in the neck, even with boxes.My name is Lalchan Lutchman, and this is my story of working at Amazon. As my story starts, I start the day by waking up early in the morning, head to the bathroom and take a shower and brush my teeth just before I have to get ready to start the day to head out. I gather my things, head straight to the train station, catch a J train, take it four stops down to transfer to the A train to take straight to Port Authority Bus Terminal, where I have to catch a bus to New Jersey. My total commute time is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is a really long commute for an essential worker to take to get to work early in the morning.

            As I get to New Jersey, I get off in Carteret, cause that’s where I have to call a Lyft to take to work since Amazon covers $12 of the trip, but it’s a 5 minute ride to work since it’s not far. As I get to the Amazon facility, I take out my badge and scan it to the turnstile to get into the facility before heading straight to the floor. First I head to the lockers to put my bag and lunch away, then I take out my PPE equipment to wear on the floor, then head out to the floor to clock in 5 minutes before the start of my shift, because my shift starts at 9:30 AM, went straight to stand up, in which everybody goes over to hear the sorting announcements, of which how much packages we are putting on the belt, the flex up situation, of which how long we have to stay extra before the end of shift because it’s a busy day at Amazon, usually it’s either 15, 30, 45, or maybe an hour based on the total of sort of the day, other times they would flex down. Breaks are 15 minutes long, but it used to be 20 minutes during the Covid pandemic, and we’re not allowed to have our phones out on the floor because it’s too distracting and because of safety issues. I always get told by the managers to not have my phone on the floor, unless if its an emergency, then I would have to step off the floor and do it outside before resuming work.
            
            Working at Amazon isn’t an easy job, their slogan is: “Work hard, Have fun, Make history”, but usually for me, it’s like boredom at most because not every day you get something good to do at your location because most like, your either working in inbound, splitting boxes, jam breaking, cart wrangling, transporting, even problem solving, those types of jobs are a pain, but some of the work I enjoy doing at Amazon is, cross dock, waterspidering, scanning, and working in the trailers. Some things at Amazon are fun, and some aren’t, but that’s hard work for me. But this type of work allows me to explore what I want to do in life because someone once told me, “if you want to achieve success, work hard, get an education, and make amends for yourself.” Amazon does have good things to offer, even with education because of your tuition and cost of needs.benefits, even with education because they pay for it, plus it gives me time to do homework even with fewer shifts. Working at Amazon is tough, but it pays well, even after a long 10 hour shift for the day.
