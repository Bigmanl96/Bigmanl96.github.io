            I was born in Brooklyn, NY on Labor Day 1996. I have been attending BMCC for many years, and already have gotten used to it since I came here in 2014. I have already gotten my first degree in Associates in Science in Engineering Science back in 2019, and now I am doing a second degree with applied science in Computer Information Systems. I was treasurer of the Robotics Club for 2 years and have received recognition as part of the Student Government Association for Best Treasurer and C.O.A.C.H. recognition for beast treasurer. In reality to what I am doing now, I now work at a warehouse over in New Jersey which considerably dislike because it is so boring, and there isnâ€™t not much to do except ship packages off a belt and place them in carts so that it would have to be loaded up into a trailer and can be shipped somewhere it has to be. Outside in life, what I like doing is taking pictures of trains, buses, going long places to clear up the mind, going to the gym, playing video games, eating, sleeping, watching videos on YouTube, watching movies on HBO max, paramount plus, going shopping, hanging with friends, going on social media, and doing homework.
